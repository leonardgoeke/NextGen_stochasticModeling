This repository provides the code and data for the second training session 2C "Methods for climate effects in energy system models" of the [Next Generation Challenges in Energy-Climate Modelling Workshop](https://research.reading.ac.uk/met-energy/next-generation-challenges-workshop/next-generation-energy-climate-modelling-2024/) in 2024. The workshop will introduce and discuss different options to account for multi-year climate data in energy system modeling to identify systems that also work under extreme weather conditions. The session partly builds on training session 1C, which focuses on obtaining climate data inputs for energy system models.

# Installation #

This repository enables workshop participants to follow the workshop step-by-step. The following steps are necessary to run the provided code and should be carried out **before the workshop**:
1. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Julia 1.10.2](https://julialang.org/downloads/oldreleases/). If you experience problems, like unexpected errors or long installation times in step 3, we recommend using the latest Julia version instead.
2. Setup Julia in VSCode installing the [Julia extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/julia)
3. Run the first code block in the *script.jl* or *script.ipynb* installing all necessary packages.
